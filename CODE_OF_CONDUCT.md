# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with new contributors learning AWS and serverless technologies
* Providing helpful guidance and mentorship to others
* Sharing knowledge and best practices openly

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Sharing AWS credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information
* Deliberately introducing security vulnerabilities or malicious code
* Spamming issues or pull requests with irrelevant content
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Contributing code, documentation, or other materials to the project
- Participating in project discussions on GitHub, Discord, or other platforms

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainer at **yadneshteli@gmail.com**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Security Considerations

### AWS Credentials and Sensitive Information

As this project involves AWS services, additional guidelines apply:

* **Never commit AWS credentials** (Access Keys, Secret Keys, or Session Tokens)
* **Never share IAM user credentials** with other contributors
* **Use IAM roles and temporary credentials** where possible
* **Report security vulnerabilities privately** to yadneshteli@gmail.com
* **Do not create public issues** for security vulnerabilities
* **Follow the principle of least privilege** when suggesting IAM policies
* **Sanitize logs** before sharing (remove account IDs, connection IDs, etc.)

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email details to **yadneshteli@gmail.com** with subject: "Security Vulnerability"
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
4. Wait for acknowledgment before public disclosure
5. Allow reasonable time (typically 90 days) for fix before disclosure

## Cost Awareness

When contributing features or suggestions:

* **Consider AWS Free Tier limits** to keep the project accessible
* **Document cost implications** of new features
* **Avoid suggestions that significantly increase costs** without clear value
* **Test in development accounts** to avoid unexpected charges
* **Clean up test resources** to avoid ongoing costs

## Learning and Mentorship

This project serves as a learning resource for AWS and serverless technologies:

* **Be patient with beginners** learning AWS concepts
* **Provide constructive feedback** on code and architecture
* **Share learning resources** (AWS documentation, tutorials, etc.)
* **Explain "why"** not just "what" when reviewing code
* **Celebrate learning milestones** and contributions from new developers
